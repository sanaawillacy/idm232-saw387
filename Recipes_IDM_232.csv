Recipe_Top_Chef_Ginger-Marinated_Grassfed_Steaks_with_Stir-Fried_Vegetables_Jasmine_RiceBlue_A,IDM232-assets\pdf\,2 Grassfed Steaks * 3/4 cup Jasmine Rice * 3 oz Radishes * 1/2 lb Baby Bok Choy * 4 oz Cremini Mushrooms * 1 Shallot * 1 Tbsp Sugar * 1 1-inch piece Ginger * 1 Tbsp Ponzu Sauce * 1 Bird’s Eye Chile Pepper * 1 Tbsp Soy Sauce * 1 Tbsp Rice Vinegar,"Peel and finely chop the ginger; place in a medium bowl. Stir in the soy sauce, ponzu sauce, and a drizzle of olive oil. * Pat the steaks dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper on both sides. Place in the bowl of marinade and turn to coat. Set aside to marinate, turning occasionally, for at least 10 minutes. * While the steaks marinate, in a medium pot, combine the rice, a big pinch of salt, and 1 1/2 cups of water. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, cover and reduce heat to low. Cook 12–14 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender. Turn off heat and fluff with a fork. Cover to keep warm. * While the rice cooks, wash and dry the fresh produce. * Quarter the mushrooms. * Peel and thinly slice the shallot. Cut off and discard the root end of the bok choy; roughly chop. * Cut off and discard the ends of the radishes; thinly slice into rounds. Place in a bowl. Stir in half the vinegar; season with salt and pepper. Set aside to marinate, stirring occasionally, for at least 10 minutes. * Cut off and discard the stem end of the pepper; thinly slice crosswise. (For a milder dish, remove and discard the seeds first.) Thoroughly wash your hands, knife, and cutting board immediately after handling. * In a medium pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the quartered mushrooms in an even layer. Cook, without stirring, 2–3 minutes, or until lightly browned. * Add the sliced shallot, chopped bok choy, and as much of the sliced pepper as you’d like; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 2–3 minutes, or until softened. * Transfer to a large bowl and stir in the remaining vinegar. Cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. Wipe out the pan. * In the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Reserving the excess marinade, add the marinated steaks. Cook, turning occasionally, 7–9 minutes for medium-rare, or until browned and cooked to your desired degree of doneness. * Leaving any browned bits in the pan, transfer steaks to a cutting board and let rest at least 5 minutes. * While the steaks rest, to the pan of reserved fond, add the reserved marinade, sugar, and 1/4 cup water (careful, as the liquid may splatter). Cook on medium-high, stirring constantly, 2–3 minutes, or until thickened. Turn off heat and season with salt and pepper to taste. * Find the lines of muscle (or grain) on the rested steaks; thinly slice crosswise against the grain. * Serve the sliced steaks with the cooked rice and cooked vegetables. Top the steaks with the sauce. Garnish with the marinated radishes (draining before adding). * Enjoy!"
